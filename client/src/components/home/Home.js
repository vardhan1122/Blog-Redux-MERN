It is a platform where a writer or a group of writers share their views on an individual subject.</p>
                            <p className="px-3 animated slideInUp">So, the main purpose of a blog is to connect you to the relevant audience. Another one is to boost your traffic and send quality leads to your website.</p>
                            <p className="px-3 animated slideInUp">The more frequent and better your blog posts are, the higher the chances for your website to get discovered and visited by your target audience. This means that a blog is an effective lead generation tool. Add a great call to action (CTA) to your content, and it will convert your website traffic into high-quality leads. A blog also allows you to showcase your niche authority and build a brand.</p>
